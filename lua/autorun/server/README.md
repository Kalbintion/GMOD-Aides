# INSTRUCTIONS
* Updating your workshop.lua file for handling automated setup of workshop downloads can be done while your server is running.
* These steps imply you are knowledgable enough to replicate what is already present to ensure the system continues to work as expected.
* The workshop.lua file offered here contains my personal collections used for TTT/2, Murder, Prophunters and Deathrun with all of their addon IDs.
* Steps
  * Visit your collection and scroll to the bottom (this ensures all items in collection are loaded on page)
  * Copy/paste raw code below
  * Open up developer console (CTRL+SHIFT+I in Chrome/FF)
  * Paste and hit enter to run
  * Right-click console output and select relevant browser specific copy menu item
    * Such as:
      * "Copy String Contents" (Chrome) **PREFERRED**
      * "Copy Message" (Firefox)
  * Open workshop.lua
  * Paste & Overwrite collectionData list
    * Note: If you're using a browser other than Chrome using the copy method mentioned above, ensure the quotes at the start and end are not present
  * Save
