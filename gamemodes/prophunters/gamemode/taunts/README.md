# Taunts
These taunt files are provided as-is. They are a bunch of the sounds from Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2. The majority of which are a part of Garry's Mod by default but not exposed by the base gamemode as taunts.

# Warnings
* Using all of these files will cause a few seconds of delay when opening up the taunt menu due to the sheer volume of taunts.
* Not all taunts provided here are suitable for in-game use
* Not all taunts are accurate for duration
* All Taunts tagged for 30,000 seconds are INFINITE and will not end, even upon player death.
